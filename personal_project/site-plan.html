        <h2> News and More</h2>
        <p>
            Basketball fans come to find the most critical data about the sport they love. They will enjoy access to
            their favorite players’ performances, classified by category, and a summary of the most heated teams and
            players. Many of the questions they have in mind when visiting the website could be summarized in these:

            What teams/players are leading in the main categories?
            Which ones have a chance to classify for the next round?
            When is it going to be the next game for their teams?

            The main page primarily provides an appetizer for the user with most of the relevant, up-to-date information
            on this fabulous sport. They want to get informed with the most updated technical data, review the analysis
            made by experts, and send or post messages about their predictions and other opinions to the site. Moreover,
            experts’ comments have one section and another so that anyone can post their opinions publicly. In the same
            way, this has links to examine further specific data related to players and teams. When the user goes over
            these features can easily navigate them, and these two links will redirect the user to the following two
            pages where team/players info is presented, or the next games will be held with their respective schedules.
        </p>
        <h2>Statistics</h2>
        <p>
            People want to know how the best players in the game are to make comparisons, value their contribution and
            estimate the players’ worth in the sports market. The stats help analyze each individual and draw
            conclusions about the previous points. Furthermore, teams are evaluated based on their collective
            performance, allowing experts to forecast which teams are more likely to advance to the next round or even
            predict with substantial accuracy who will reach the top positions for each league division. Finally,
            gamblers are not different, and they also use this information to bet, which is now legal entertainment in
            many countries. In other words, this technical data helps people outside the interest of the sport to make a
            profit out of it.

            Coaches and team managers are highly interested in those statistical figures to identify issues, strengths,
            and weaknesses. Otherwise, it would be too subjective to make decisions when there are personal preferences
            for everyone on the team. Players can prove their added value to the team by showing positive numbers while
            on the court; these metrics will speak for themselves. All these groups of people will use the information
            for different purposes, but every one of them can be sure that the presented numbers do not lie. In short,
            numbers illustrate a clear picture of what is happening, more importantly, what is more likely to happen by
            following current trends.

        <h2>Games Schedule</h2>
        <p>
            This is the last webpage listing the next games so users/fans can follow up on their team’s upcoming events.
            There the user will see if the team is local or visitor if there is live transmission, and the time of the
            game. Even when not many more details or extra information are added to this third page, the objective is to
            inform about team games clearly and concisely. All the data used in this case comes from NBA through Google
            search.
