        I'm currently pursuing Software Engineering. I love to learn, and online learning allows me to do so during a
        time that would be difficult for me to attend on campus. I've been married for more than a decade to my lovely
        wife. We have two children growing up to become teenagers. A little worried about the last, lol. I grew up in
        the church and served a full-time mission. It was the best time of my life before getting the chance to have my
        own family.

        I'm pretty new to programming and producing virtual content; however, I do like it and hope to absorb as much as
        possible from those with more experience in this field. I hope to get the most out of this course; in
        particular, learn from the available material, Brother Johnson, and my classmates. <i><b>Thank you in advance
                for your feedback to learn and grow together!</b></i></p>
